# WeatherUI App

## Description

### Important Libraries
* Bootstrap + Bootstrap Angular UI
  * Although there are various newer, "sexier" options, Bootstrap is tried and true and simple to implement.
  One goal of this project is to have as simple/non-existent a back-end as possible; CSS libraries such as Semantic UI
   benefit more from additional Gulp scripting for theming and configuration, which I wanted to avoid.
   Finally, the Bootstrap Angular UI is well established and useful.
* Karma / Jasmine
  * Established libraries for running front-end tests.
* Leaflet
  * Necessary for displaying maps.
